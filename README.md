# bootstrapPortfolio
This is a mini-portfolio about myself using HTML powered by the CSS framework Bootstrap. 
## Live Url
[Live application](https://usualketchup.github.io/bootstrapPortfolio/index.html)

## Description
This mini portfolio acts as a mobile responsive website that allows the user to click on different information. 
The user can click on the portfolio button to get linked to my portfolio. The user can also send me an email through the contact feature 

## Languages
This website uses HTML and the framework Bootstrap to improve the aesthetic features of the website.

## Challenges 
Some challenges that I faced making this website was learning how to properly use Bootstrap and how to readjust more things about each website.
As I learned more about these files, I learned that it was not too difficult to work through all of the files and fix things that needed more padding or something like that.
